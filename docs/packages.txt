-- Doost!

goal: keep things simple and allow for future enhancements and changes to component
implementations.

main issue: go packages can not have ciruclar dependencies. 
couterpoint: go standard library is extensive. there is a way.

approach --

inclusion will be from top to bottom: 
	package gart -> any nested package
	package index -> any nested package

2 categories of widely accessed elements:
	a - system constants 
		such as gart.Dir, gart.TagsetFile, etc.
	b - system types
		such as OID (as of now the only one)

sketch:
	gart\
		capability\
			init.go
			add.go
			search.go
			tag.go
			integrity.go
			...
		cmd\
			process.go
			gart-init.go
			gart-add.go
			gart-tag.go
			gart-find.go
			...
		system\				revu: maybe this should just be pulled up to gart.
			consts.go		ok	ex: const gart.system.Dirname = ".gart"
			errors.go		ok		std error handling
			types.go		ok	ex: type gart.system.OID struct {...}
							    	type gart.system.Context
									OID, Bitmap, ... ? NO. 
									(possibly) Device, Volume, Tag, Card, Object, Index
			runtime.go		ok	ex: type gart.system.Context
		syslib\				revu: no package in syslib/* should refer to anything
								  outside of syslib or go stdlib.
			digest\
				digest.go	ok
			bitmap\
				bitmap.go
				bah.go
				wah.go
			fs\
				file.go		ok
			sort\
				sort.go		ok
			timestamp\	
				unixtime.go	no: it is only used in cardfile for apparently 2 reasons:
								1 - it is 32 bits and keeps card header size == 32B (why?) 
								2 - we don't really need nanosec precision for card files.
		index\
			index.go		
							why not: (or use system instead of gart)
								type gart.Oid
								type gart.Index
								type gart.Card << revu: requires 'Bitmap' WHY?
								type gart.Tag 

							no: circular >> support interface: gart.system.Index
			provider.go  
							gart.index.Cards
							gart.index.Objects
							gart.index.Tags
							gart.index.Devices
			/* provider implementations */
			tag\	<< RENAME
				tagdict.go	was: tagmap.go
			cards\
				cardfile.go		-- fs based Cards
			objects\
				mmap.go			-- mapped file Objects
			tags\
								-- mapped file object-tag column Tags
			devices\			-- tbd
			volumes\			-- tbd
